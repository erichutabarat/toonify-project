# Toonify Project
Toonify is a camera-based filter that changes the appearance of the user's face into a unique cartoon style. Leveraging OpeCV and MediaPipe, this filter detects faces and creates a subtle cartoon effect with sharp outlines and soft colors. It's easy to use, fast, and provides an experience like popular social media filters.
